What Went Well
---
We finished the second command line tasks

What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
---
* Focus: We could be more efficient in finding the repositories during the command line

* Communication: We could have talked a little more

* Pacing: We could have done some fo the tasks a little faster

* Division of responsibility: We did pretty good for each of our roles

* Code quality: Most of it worked right away.
