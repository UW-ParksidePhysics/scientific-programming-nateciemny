What Went Well
--- Quick and made sense


What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
---
* Focus: allow permission access

* Communication: Could relay information a little faster

* Pacing: Could type a little bit faster

* Division of responsibility: We could find out who is a better driver and navigator and decide our roles based on that.

* Code quality: We could try to have less typos
