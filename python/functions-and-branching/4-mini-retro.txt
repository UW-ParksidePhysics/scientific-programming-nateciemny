What Went Well

We were able to start the code

What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
---
* Focus: Be more efficient when typing

* Communication: We could relay information more efficiently

* Pacing: We could be more productive with each individual exercise

* Division of responsibility: Not much could change

* Code quality: No errors but code was not finished
